# 305-Hackathon-2025
This project focuses on improving street safety and inclusivity by designing a system that protects and advises blind pedestrians when approaching a street crossing. The system simulates real-world scenarios where pedestrians may wrongfully cross during the incorrect light signal, and provides immediate alerts while adapting traffic light behavior to enhance safety. 
How It Works

Pedestrian Detection:
Touch sensors simulate cars making contact on the street, triggering the system to monitor crossing behavior.

Real-Time Alerts:
If a blind pedestrian attempts to cross during the wrong signal, the system sends alerts to notify them of the danger.

Traffic Light Control:
The system can override and change the simulated traffic lights to prevent accidents in case of wrongful crossing.
ESP8266 (microcontroller for processing and communication)

Hardware Components:
Touch Sensor (detects simulated unsafe car activity when pedestrians are crosing)
Ultrasonic Sensors (detect obstacles and crossing activity)
LEDs (simulate traffic light signals on a breadboard circuit)
Breadboard & Wiring (hardware simulation setup)

The project was inspired by the need for inclusive technology in urban environments. Blind and visually impaired individuals often face risks at street crossings, and this system proposes an IoT-based solution to reduce accidents and enhance safety.
